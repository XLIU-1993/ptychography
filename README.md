# ptychography
Ptychography simulation and reconstruction module based on PyNx version 20210502, specialized for Helix project at CEA saclay.

I'm currently running the code on cpu, however the cpu operator of PyNx was not well developped. So I write the 'simulation.py'
by myself.

This simulation.py script is pretty realistic one, a virtuel camera is simulated.

To run these scripts, one needs to colone the 'pynx' repository into python/Lib/site-backages/pynx.

Then colone this 'ptychography' repository into whereever you want.

Follow instructions and install necessary python packages, you should be able to simulate a typical ptychography experiment,
with reconstruction.

Noted that these code were wrote for my personal perpose, I'm just starting code in python. So don't hesite to contact me and
give some advises. Thanks!
